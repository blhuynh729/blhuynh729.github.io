## Welcome 👋

This site is your “lab partner” for ENG 03: wiring, sensors, and Arduino programming—organized so you can find the answer fast.

## Quick start (10 minutes)

1. Install the Arduino IDE
2. Plug in your board and select the correct port
3. Upload **File → Examples → 01.Basics → Blink**
4. Open **Sensors** and try your first build

## What you’ll learn

- Build and wire circuits confidently
- Read sensors (digital + analog) and interpret data
- Debug sketches and fix common wiring mistakes
- Build mini projects that interact with the physical world

## How the docs are structured

- **Setup**: installation + first upload
- **Sensors**: wiring + working code + pitfalls
- **Troubleshooting**: quick fixes when something isn’t working
